                         Hi There!
                         I've had the fortune of being alive for 23 incredible years now and I've picked up a lot of skills along the way.(I make some of the best tomato rice this side of the Atlantic, can't beat my Amma though :D).
                         Raised in South India, I love idlis, dosas, filter coffee, cricket and lots of math!
                         An avid reader, I look at the world through a lens that's coloured by the thoughts and ruminations of some of the greatest minds from the East and the West.
                         My parents, Vyasa, Valmiki, Krishna, Vivekananada, Maha Periyava on one side and my parents,Steven Erikson, Asimov, Clarke, Newton, Einstein, Feynman and the rest on the other.
                         Yeah, my parents are on both sides depending on their mood. Can never thank them enough :D.
                         Though I have a Bachelor's Degree in Instrumentation and Control from the best National Institute of Technology in India, NIT-Tiruchirappalli and a Masters in Electrical Engineering from North Carolina State University, I've always been more of a generalist and believe strongly in lifelong learning.So,if you're looking to talk to someone about any of the following: Instrumentation, Control Systems, Electrical Engineering, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, Robotics or any other topic under the sun, you've come to the right place!

                         I'm currently working with an awesome team at Google MTV applying my hardware and software skills to build smarter access control systems.

                         Scroll down for more information about my current and past projects.
                         For more information, reach out via email and I will get back to you :D
                         Have a great day\afternoon\evening\night!

                        <p>
                            Many industrial projects involve the use of prefabricated modules built offsite, and installation on-site using mobile cranes. Due to their costly operation and safety concerns, utilization of such heavy lift mobile cranes requires a precise lift planning. Traditional lift planning methods on congested industrial job sites are ineffective, time-consuming and non-precise in many cases, whereas computer-based simulation can be a better tool. By providing a VR environment in which the crane crew can experience lifting process. Providing such VR simulation not only facilitates planning for lifts, but also provides a training environment to enhance safe climate prior to the actual lift. The developed VR model is implemented successfully on an actual construction site of a petrochemical plant on a modular basis in which heavy lift mobile cranes are employed.

                        <p>
                           The objective of this project is to provide a framework for a remote monitoring system that provides a realistic experience and immersive 360 views of the construction site to managers in real time, who may be located thousands of miles from the construction sites. The system uses 3D 360 cameras, which are mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, operated remotely by the managers. The two onboard computer systems enable remote operation of the UAV and live-streaming of stereo 360 video content via a cloud-based server. The stereoscopic video is viewed by the managers (can be viewed by multiple people as well) in a VR headset which gives them a sense of realism and emotional and cognitive presence which is important for accurate monitoring and decision-making.

                        <p>
                           To minimize the impact of change orders on the design and total cost, an approach that allows communication and interaction with 3D models through advanced visualization tools (i.e., virtual and augmented reality environments) can be effective. To further identify the influence of immersive virtual environments(IVEs) on project management, a systematic approach is proposed through which stakeholders can: (1) visualize and interact with 3D models in one-to-one scaled realistic virtual environments (fully immersive); and (2) visualize the dollar amount changes as the results of change orders. The results of the presented case study show that clients can exercise the ability to make changes virtually well before actual construction begins.

                        <p>
                           Bridges play a critical role in the transportation system network; accordingly, assuring satisfaction with the service level of these structures is vital for managers. However, determining which elements of a bridge to repair by which method in any given year, based on budget limitations over time in a bridge with several elements, is a complicated task. Researchers have focused on developing various optimization models (e.g. Genetic algorithm) to deal with such an optimization problem. This study focuses on developing an integrated framework based on BIM and bridge maintenance management. BIM not only enhances visualization capabilities to assist maintenance managers in making decisions, but also automatically feeds into the optimization system. The introduced system is successfully verified using a real-world case study.

                        <p>
                            The objective of this study is to predict overflows in stormwater networks using smart cities technologies and data-driven models and improve collaboration between utility managers using smart visualization techniques.
To achieve this, the authors utilized digital twin models in a Mixed Reality (MR) environment which is connected to a real-time overflow prediction model based on forecasted precipitation or rainfall hydrograph.
The results indicate that it is possible to predict pipe overflows in stormwater networks using neural networks with a very high accuracy and connect that model to a MR environment in a 3D engine.
Conclusion: The prediction model which is proposed by the authors in this study can improve the efficiency in stormwater management systems and help utility managers in hard decision making processes.
